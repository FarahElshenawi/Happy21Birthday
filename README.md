# Fireworks Simulation

This project is a fireworks simulation implemented using PyOpenGL. It generates colorful fireworks explosions on the screen.

## Features

- Randomly generates fireworks explosions with various colors and sizes.
- Simulates particle trails for added visual effects.
- Implements gravity for realistic particle movement.

## Demo Video

Check out the [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ip7aaXo0-fBN7ic9XX8a6UKJw6qcZnqb/view?usp=drive_link) to see the fireworks simulation in action.

I also added audio to the video to make it more engaging. While it was easy to do using Pygame, my PC had some problems, so I added the audio to the video instead.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and PyOpenGL installed.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.

```bash
python main.py
